</h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The Options menu item in the <B>Execute</B> menu brings up a
    dialog box with five tabs.
    In the first tab, the IO Connections tab, the user can specify where each
    <A HREF="../specifications/micros/io.html">IO microinstruction</A> will get or put
    data (see Figure 14).
    In the second tab, the user can choose which lines of code are to be highlighted while
    stepping through
    the code in debug mode. In the third tab, the Loading tab, the user specifies in which
    RAM and on which
    starting line the code should be loaded. In the fourth tab, the Punctuation tab, the
    user can
    specify which ASCII characters are comments, tokens, symbols, pseudos, labels, or
    illegal. And finally, in the last tab, users can specify whether they want the
    indexing of bits in a register to start at the left (most significant bit) or at the
    right (least significant bit).</FONT></P>

    <BR>Figure 14. The IO connections tab of the Options dialog.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The table has one row for each IO microinstruction in the current
    machine. The "name" column
    gives the name of the IO microinstruction. The "connection" column gives the current
    source or destination for the
    data when the microinstruction is executed. If the connection is "[Dialog]" then the
    data is sent to or read from the
    user via a dialog box, one data value at a time. If the connection is "[Console]" then
    the data is sent to or read
    from the user, one data value at a time, via the console panel at the bottom of the
    main desktop window.
    The console panel is highlighted in yellow whenever it is waiting for the user to type
    in a value. If the connection
    is a file name, then the data is sent to or read from that file. The file must be a
    text file. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">If you select "File..." from the popup menu, a dialog box will
    appear in which you can choose
    a new text file to be the source or destination of the data. If two IO
    microinstructions both read from the same
    file or both write to the same file, they do so using the same data stream. That is,
    if one IO microinstruction
    reads a value from the file, then the other IO microinstruction cannot read that value
    from the file and instead
    will read the next value.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">When CPU Sim attempts to read a base-10 integer from a text file,
    it reads past any white
    space (space, new line, carriage return, and tab characters), reads an optional '+' or
    '-' character, and then
    reads and appends digits (0-9) until a non-digit character is encountered. When CPU
    Sim attempts to read a character
    (ASCII or Unicode) from a file, it just reads the next character of the file. If you
    want to store binary data
    in a text file to be read by an IO microinstruction, precede the binary digits with a
    "0b". For example, if you
    want to store the binary value of "-1101" then the text file should have the value
    "-0b1101". If you want to store
    hexademical data in a file for later reading by an IO microinstruction, precede the
    hexadecimal value with the
    prefix "0x". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">When CPU Sim attempts to write an integer to a text file, it
    first writes a space character
    so that successively written integers can be distinguished from each other. It then
    writes the integer in base 10
    format. When CPU Sim attempts to write a character (ASCII or Unicode) to a file, it
    writes the character
    immediately with no additional spacing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">When a program is run using the "Assemble, load, & run", "Run",
    &quot;Clear registers &amp; run&quot;, or "Clear, assemble, load & run" menu items in
    the <B> Execute</B> menu,
    the data files are opened just before running and are closed when execution is halted
    (for whatever reason).
    If the user enters <A HREF="../other/debugMode.html">debug mode</A>, the files are
    opened when execution begins
    for the first time (by clicking the "Go", "Step by Instr", or "Step by Micro"
    buttons). When in debug mode, the
    files are not closed until the user exits from debug mode, the user clicks the "Start
    over" button in the debug
    toolbar, or the user selects a new connection (using the "Options..."
    menu item) for the IO
    microinstruction connected to the file.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">NOTE: Clicking the "Backup one Instr" or "Backup one Micro"
    buttons in the debug toolbar
    does not back up the reading or writing of text files. That is, the current position
    of reading from or writing
    to text files does not change when you click the "Backup one Instr" or "Backup one
    Micro" button.</FONT></P>

    highlighting tab in the Options dialog.</FONT>
</P>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>The Highlighting tabbed pane includes a table in which the
    user can choose which lines of code are to be highlighted while stepping through the
    code. Note that this
    highlighting
    occurs only when the code is executing in <A HREF="../other/debugMode.html">debug
        mode</A>. The highlighting is
    specified via pairs consisting of a register and an RAM. The row of the RAM whose
    address corresponds to the value
    of the register is highlighted. </P>

    <P>For example, the user may wish to highlight the current top of the stack while
        stepping through the code. To do so,
        the user needs to create a new register/RAM pair where the register is the stack
        top pointer register (containing
        the address of the top of the stack) and the RAM is the stack RAM.</P>

    <P>The user may also wish to highlight the cell of main memory containing the
        currently executing instruction. This
        row normally corresponds to the address in the program counter register. In this
        case, the user would create a new
        register/RAM pair with the program counter register and the code store RAM. NOTE:
        If the user creates such a pair,
        then, when stepping through the code, the row of source code (in the assembly
        text editor) corresponding to the
        highlighted row of the code store RAM will also be highlighted.</P></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">If the user wishes the highlighting to be updated after each
    microinstruction step, then
    the &quot;Dynamic&quot; checkbox should be checked. Otherwise, the highlighting is
    updated only at the beginning
    of each machine cycle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The Loading tabbed pane allows the user
    to specify which RAM is the code store, i.e., the RAM in which assembled code is to
    be loaded. The user can also
    specify which address of the code store is to be the starting address for
    loading.  To enter a value in
    binary, use the prefix "0b" and to enter a value in hexadecimal, use the
    prefix "0x". The tool tip for the starting address box shows the value in other bases.

    Punctuation tab of the Options dialog.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The &quot;Punctuation &quot; tabbed pane (see Figure 27) is for
    specifying the uses of
    some of the assembly syntax punctuation characters. To change the use of a character,
    choose a new item from the
    popup menu in the right column next to the character. These changes are saved with the
    current machine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">You can change the character indicating the start of a comment,
    the character indicating the
    end of a label, and the first character in a pseudo-instruction. The default
    characters
    are semicolon (;),
    colon (:), and period (.), respectively. There must be exactly one character used for
    each of these three roles,
    and those three characters must be distinct from each other.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">You can also indicate whether a punctuation character should be
    considered a token all by
    itself or whether it should be part of a symbol, which means it is joined with
    surrounding characters when forming
    a token. For example, if the character '!' is used as part of a symbol (as indicated
    in Figure 27), then the
    string &quot;ab!4&quot; will be parsed as one token. However, if '!' is used as a
    token by itself, then the string
    &quot;ab!4&quot; will be parsed as three tokens: &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, and
    &quot;4&quot;. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">Finally, you can specify which punctuation characters are
    illegal, which means they are not
    allowed to appear anywhere in an assembly language program except inside comments or
    strings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The plus (+) and minus (-) characters have some special behavior.
    They are always legal as
    the first character of a number token but they can be symbol, token, or illegal
    characters otherwise. They cannot
    be the comment, pseudo, or label characters.</FONT></P>

    <IMG border="1px" src="./Indexing.png" HEIGHT="455" WIDTH="580"><BR>Figure 14. The IO
    connections dialog.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">When choosing a range of bits in a register, for example, for
    use in a Transfer microinstruction, the user chooses which bits are included in the
    range by specifying the indices of those bits.  The Indexing tab allows the user
    to specify whether bits in registers should be indexed from the left (the most significant bit)
    or the right (the least significant bit).  For example, if indexing starts from the
    left, then bits 0-3 are the leftmost 4 bits in the register.  If indexing starts
    from the right, then the rightmost 4 bits are specified by bits 0-3.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">If you create
    some microinstructions using indexing from one end and then switch to indexing from
    the other end, CPU Sim will, with your approval, update the existing microinstructions
    to use the new indexing order.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The "Apply" button immediately applies the changes you made in
    the three tabs without closing the dialog box. The "Close" button closes the dialog
    without applying any of the changes (but previous applications of changes made using
    the "Apply" button will remain
    in effect). The "OK" button applies all changes and closes the dialog.</FONT></P>
