		<FONT FACE="Palatino">Debug mode provides you with several
			tools for finding bugs in your code, including the following:</FONT>
	</P>
	<OL>
		<LI><FONT FACE="Palatino">You can step through the code
				one machine instruction or one microinstruction at a time. As you do
				so, the name of the current machine instruction being executed is
				displayed on the right end of the debug toolbar, along with the
				microinstructions composing it, which are displayed in a scroll box.
				The specific microinstruction being executed is highlighted in the
				scroll box. If you step by microinstruction, then any register and
				RAM cells that are changed during execution are outlined in green.
				After each step you can inspect and change the values stored in any
				register or RAM. Note: At the beginning of each machine cycle the
                fetch sequence is listed as the current instruction in the debug toolbar
            and its microinstruction sequence is listed, because it is what is executed
            next.  However, after executing the Decode
            microinstruction in the fetch sequence, the toolbar will display the name
            of the decoded instruction and its microinstruction sequence.
        </FONT></LI>
		<LI><FONT FACE="Palatino">You can back up one machine
				instruction at a time, which resets the values of the registers and
				RAMs to their state at the start of the last machine cycle.</FONT></LI>
		<LI><FONT FACE="Palatino">You can also back up one
				microinstruction at a time, which resets the values of the registers
				and RAMs to their state at the start of the last microinstruction.</FONT></LI>
		<LI><FONT FACE="Palatino">Using the Highlighting tab
				within the "<A HREF="../windows/OptionsDialog.html">Options
					Dialog</A>", you can specify cells of RAMs to be highlighted as you
				step through the code. For example, suppose you have a stack and a
				stack top register. You can tell CPU Sim to highlight, after each
				step, the row of the stack RAM whose address is in the stack top
				register. Similarly, if you have a program counter, you can tell CPU
				Sim to highlight the row of the code RAM whose address is in the
				program counter during each step. In the latter case, CPU Sim will
				also highlight the row of source code corresponding to the
				highlighted row of RAM, as you step through the code.
		</FONT></LI>
		<LI><FONT FACE="Palatino">You can specify break points at
				any line of code by clicking on the left side of the line
				which will cause a red circle to appear there.
                When that line of code is accessed (via a <A
				HREF="../specifications/micros/memoryAccess.html">MemoryAccess</A>
				microinstruction) for either reading or writing, the MemoryAccess
				microinstruction is executed and then execution halts. When the
				program halts, the line of code that caused the break is selected in
				the text editor. At that point, you can inspect and/or edit the
				contents of all registers and RAMs and back up or resume execution.
