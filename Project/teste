; W2-1.a
; This program reads in two arbitrary (positive or negative)
; integers m and n and outputs the product of m and n,
; without using the multiply machine instruction.
; It is for the Wombat2 and uses as few memory accesses
; as possible.

; R0 holds n
; R1 holds abs(m), which is decremented
; R2 holds the sum so far
; R3 holds the constant -1 for decrementing m
